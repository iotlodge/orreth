# Orreth

**A security-first, identity-anchored memory across spacetime — Universes of Ecosystems of Fields of Agents.**

An agent today is only as good as its data, and its data is bounded by time. Orreth uses the running
universe as **memory that never fades** (configurable for years) and is **not lonely** (collective,
cross-agent, authorized). **Governance is its first application, not its purpose.**

> Three flows: **policy cascades down** (foundational, non-overridable) · **memory rises up** (pruned at
> every layer) · **retrieval escalates up by time-horizon** (Sourced + Verified). Identity is the immortal
> thread; the Universe is both the **foundation** (policy) and the **apex** (all-time memory).
> *Security first. Trust, but verify — at ecosystem scale.*

## Status

🟣 **Design phase.** No application code yet — this is deliberate. We are designing a
*lightweight architecture that can be expanded* before we build. The vision is captured; the
build-phase design specs are being written one keystone at a time (see `docs/design/`).

The brand name **Orreth** is locked. The domain (`orreth.ai` / `.com`) showed no DNS delegation at
capture time but is **not yet purchased** — confirm at a registrar + a trademark glance before spending.

## The center, and the mechanism

**The center — what Orreth *is*.** A memory substrate for **Living Identities**. An agent's process is
ephemeral (online / offline / reboot); its **identity is the immortal thread**, universe-unique, and
**memory is keyed to the identity, not the process.** Reboot is not death. Governance (drift → tune) is
the *first application* the substrate powers, not the point.

**The mechanism — how it's built.** One recursive primitive — the **Harness** — with `tier` as a property
(a **Tier Profile**), not three codebases. Children are Harnesses until the leaf **Field**, whose children
are living **Agents**.

- **Multiverse is free** — a Harness above Universes is just another Harness.
- **A 2-tier customer is free** — "just an Ecosystem with Fields" is a depth-2 tree.
- Depth is **capped at 3** (Universe / Ecosystem / Field) until we prove it out; expandable by design.

> Harnesses all the way down, until agents. The only special node is the Field — where governance meets a life.

## The lineage — three projects, one fabric

| Layer | Project | Where it lives | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Universe** (apex + recursive runtime) | **Orreth** | this repo | the recursive Harness runtime; tier = a profile |
| **Ecosystem** | **ecosystem.harness** (EH) | `../ecosystem.harness` | the governance loop, proven (61 tests, end-to-end). Its engine **lifts** into Orreth as the node core. |
| **Field** | **CortexObserver** | `../CortexObserver/CortexObserver` | a full CortexObserver per line-of-business — commander, roster, farms, skills, memory |
| **Agents** | LangGraph · AgentField | (in each Field) | the workforce; DID-identified via becky → NANDA; built or leased |

**Start here:** `docs/vision/FUTURE-the-orreth.md` is the full vision. `docs/design/` is where
the vision becomes buildable, one schema at a time.

## Principles

- **Security first. Trust, but verify — foundationally, from the Universe down.** Universal policy is non-overridable; **retrieval is the #1 security surface.**
- **Identity is the thread; memory is the life.** The process is disposable; the identity and its memory are not.
- **The layers prune so the Universe holds only what matters.** Compression is the shape of the pyramid.
- **Skills are crystallized memory** — learn once, stop re-remembering.
- **Retrieval spans spacetime — Sourced and Verified, or not at all.**
- **Humans conduct; agents perform — and now, agents remember forever.**
